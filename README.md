# SVG Drawing of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj using Python and Turtle Graphics

This Python script utilizes the Turtle graphics module to programmatically draw and color an SVG image of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The process involves parsing an SVG file, extracting vector path data, and interpreting color fill information. The script then calculates coordinates to draw each path, scaling it to the desired output size, and controls the turtle to produce and display the image.

## SVG Parsing:
- The script reads an SVG file containing the vector path data and color fill information.

## Path Calculation:
- Coordinates for drawing each path are calculated, ensuring proper scaling for the desired output size.

## Turtle Graphics:
- The Turtle graphics module is employed to control the drawing process, replicating the SVG image.
